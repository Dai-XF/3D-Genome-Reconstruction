# 3D Genome Structure Reconstruction of *E. coli* using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code, data, and results for a project that compares two deep learning models‚ÄîREACH-3D and TECH-3D‚Äîfor reconstructing the 3D structure of the *E. coli* genome from Hi-C data.

## üß™ Models

### [REACH-3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09619)
An unsupervised autoencoder with LSTM layers, trained directly on experimental Hi-C matrices.

### [TECH-3D](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.15.472387v1)
A supervised model trained on synthetic Hi-C/structure pairs using a bidirectional LSTM with a three-part loss function (biological smoothness, structural correlation, distance accuracy).
